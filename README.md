# `restful-react`

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/restful-react.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/restful-react)

Building React apps that interact with a RESTful API presents a set of questions, challenges and potential gotchas. This project aims to remove such pitfalls, and provide a pleasant developer experience when crafting such applications.

It can be considered **a thin wrapper around the [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) in the form of React components and hooks.**

When used in a setup with [OpenAPI / Swagger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAPI_Specification) specs and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), **restful-react ensures a reliable and always up to date contract between backend and frontend.** It generates components and types from your specs and can be integrated quite comfortably into your development workflows (featuring for example the import of OpenAPI specs from your github repos).

restful-react is **very well tested, production ready** and powers all of our projects at Contiamo.

## Overview

At its core, `restful-react` exposes a [hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), called `useGet`. This component retrieves data, either on mount or later, and then handles error states, loading states, and other cases for you. As such, you get a component that _gets stuff_ and then does stuff with it. Here's a quick overview what it looks like.

[![Edit restful-react demos](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/restful-react-demos-vjets)

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useGet } from "restful-react";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { data: randomDogImage } = useGet({
    path: "https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random",
  });

  return <img alt="Here's a good boye!" src={randomDogImage && randomDogImage.message} />;
};

export default MyComponent;
```

and on React Native,
[Edit restful-react basic demo on Expo](https://snack.expo.io/SJaSAj49r)

```jsx
import { AppRegistry, Image } from "react-native";
import React from "react";

import { useGet } from "restful-react";

const App = () => {
  const { data: randomDogImage } = useGet({
    path: "https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random",
  });
  return (
    <>
      {randomDogImage && (
        <Image
          style={{ width: 250, height: 250 }}
          source={{
            uri: randomDogImage.message,
          }}
        />
      )}
    </>
  );
};

AppRegistry.registerComponent("react-native-app", () => App);
```

## Getting Started

To install and use this library, install it by running `yarn add restful-react`, or `npm i restful-react --save` and you should be good to go. Don't forget to `import { useGet } from "restful-react"` or similar wherever you need it!

## Features

`restful-react` ships with the following features that we think might be useful.

### Global Configuration

REST API endpoints usually sit alongside a base, global URL. As a convenience, the `RestfulProvider` allows top-level configuration of your requests, that are then passed down the React tree to `useGet` hooks.

Consider,

[![Edit restful-react demos](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/restful-react-demos-vjets)

```jsx
// index.js

import React from "react";
import { RestfulProvider } from "restful-react";

import App from "./App.jsx";

const MyRestfulApp = () => (
  <RestfulProvider base="https://dog.ceo/api">
    <App />
  </RestfulProvider>
);

export default MyRestfulApp;
```

Meanwhile, in `./App.jsx`,

```jsx
// App.jsx

import React from "react";
import { useGet } from "restful-react";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { data: randomDogImage } = useGet({
    // Inferred from RestfulProvider in index.js
    path: "breeds/image/random",
  });

  return <img alt="Here's a good boye!" src={randomDogImage && randomDogImage.message} />;
};

export default MyComponent;
```

Naturally, the request will be sent to the full path `https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random`. The full API of the `RestfulProvider` is outlined below. Each configuration option is composable and _can be_ overridden by `Get` components further down the tree.

#### `RestfulProvider` API

Here's a full overview of the API available through the `RestfulProvider`, along with its defaults.

```tsx
// Interface
export interface RestfulReactProviderProps<T = any> {
  /** The backend URL where the RESTful resources live. */
  base: string;
  /**
   * The path that gets accumulated from each level of nesting
   * taking the absolute and relative nature of each path into consideration
   */
  parentPath?: string;
  /**
   * A function to resolve data return from the backend, most typically
   * used when the backend response needs to be adapted in some way.
   */
  resolve?: ResolveFunction<T>;
  /**
   * Options passed to the fetch request.
   */
  requestOptions?: ((url: string, method: string, requestBody?: string) => Partial<RequestInit>) | Partial<RequestInit>;
  /**
   * Trigger on each error.
   * For `Get` and `Mutation` calls, you can also call `retry` to retry the exact same request.
   * Please note that it's quite hard to retrieve the response data after a retry mutation in this case.
   * Depending of your case, it can be easier to add a `localErrorOnly` on your `Mutate` component
   * to deal with your retry locally instead of in the provider scope.
   */
  onError?: (err: any, retry: () => Promise<T | null>, response?: Response) => void;
  /**
   * Trigger on each request.
   */
  onRequest?: (req: Request) => void;
  /**
   * Trigger on each response.
   */
  onResponse?: (req: Response) => void;
  /**
   * Query parameters passed to each request.
   */
  queryParams?: { [key: string]: any };
  /**
   * Query parameter stringify options applied for each request.
   */
  queryParamStringifyOptions?: IStringifyOptions;
}

// Usage
<RestfulProvider
  base="String!"
  resolve={data => data}
  requestOptions={(url, method, requestBody) => ({ headers: { Authorization: authToken } })}
/>;
```

Here's some docs about the [RequestInit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/Request) type of request options.

### Loading and Error States

`useGet` hooks return an object with loading and error states, to allow for state handling. Consider,

[![Edit restful-react demos](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/restful-react-demos-vjets)

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useGet } from "restful-react";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { data: randomDogImage, loading } = useGet({
    path: "https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random",
  });

  return loading ? <h1>Loading...</h1> : <img alt="Here's a good boye!" src={randomDogImage.message} />;
};

export default MyComponent;
```

### Lazy Fetching

It is possible to use a `useGet` hook and defer the fetch to a later stage. This is done with the `lazy` boolean property. This is great for displaying UI immediately, and then allowing parts of it to be fetched as a response to an event: like the click of a button, for instance. Consider,

[![Edit restful-react demos](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/restful-react-demos-vjets)

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useGet } from "restful-react";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { data: randomDogImage, loading, refetch } = useGet({
    path: "https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random",
    lazy: true,
  });

  return !randomDogImage && loading ? (
    <h1>Loading!</h1>
  ) : (
    <div>
      <div>
        <h1>Welcome to my image getter!</h1>
        <button onClick={() => refetch()}>Get a good boye!</button>
      </div>
      <div>{randomDogImage && <img alt="Here's a good boye!" src={randomDogImage.message} />}</div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

The above example will display your UI, and then load good boyes on demand.

### Response Resolution

Sometimes, your backend responses arrive in a shape that you might want to adapt, validate, or restructure. Other times, maybe your data consistently arrives in a `{ data: {} }` shape, with `data` containing the stuff you want.

At the `RestfulProvider` level, _or_ on the `useGet` level, a `resolve` prop will take the data and _do stuff_ to it, providing the final resolved or unwrapped data to the children. Consider,

[![Edit restful-react demos](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/restful-react-demos-vjets)

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useGet } from "restful-react";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { data: imageUrl } = useGet({
    path: "https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random",
    resolve: image => image && image.message,
  });

  return imageUrl && <img alt="Here's a good boye!" src={imageUrl} />;
};

export default MyComponent;
```

### Debouncing Requests

Some requests fire in response to a rapid succession of user events: things like autocomplete or resizing a window. For this reason, users sometimes need to wait until all the keystrokes are typed (until everything's _done_), before sending a request.

`restful-react` exposes a `debounce` prop on `Get` that does exactly this.

Here's an example:

```jsx
const SearchThis = props => {
  const { data } = useGet({
    path: "/hello/world",
    debounce: true,
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Here's all the things I search</h1>
      <ul>
        {data.map(thing => (
          <li>{thing}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Debounce also accepts a number, which tells `useGet` how long to wait until doing the request.

```diff
const SearchThis = props => {
  const { data } = useGet({
    path: "/hello/world",
-    debounce: true,
+    debounce: 200 /* ms */,
  })

  return <div>
        <h1>Here's all the things I search</h1>
        <ul>
          {data.map(thing => (
            <li>{thing}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </div>
}
```

It uses [lodash's debounce](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10#debounce) function under the hood, so you get all the benefits of it out of the box like so!

```diff

const SearchThis = props => {
  const { data } = useGet({
    path: "/hello/world",
-    debounce: 200,
+    debounce: { wait: 200, options: { leading: true, maxWait: 300, trailing: false } } /* ms */,
  })

  return <div>
        <h1>Here's all the things I search</h1>
        <ul>
          {data.map(thing => (
            <li>{thing}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </div>
}
```

### TypeScript Integration

One of the most powerful features of `restful-react` is that each component exported is strongly typed, empowering developers through self-documenting APIs.

![Using restful-react in VS Code](assets/labs.gif)

### Query Parameters

All components in this library support query params (`https://my.site/?query=param`) via a `queryParams` prop. Each `useGet`, `useMutate` and `Poll` instance is _generic_, having a type signature of `useGet<TData, TError, TQueryParams>`. If described, the `queryParams` prop is _fully_ type-safe in usage and provides autocomplete functionality.

![Autocompletion on QueryParams](assets/idp.gif)

Please note that the above example was built using our [OpenAPI generator](#code-generation) in order to infer the type of component from the specification and automatically generate the entire type-safe component in a _very_ quick and easy way.

### Mutations with `useMutate`

`restful-react` exposes an additional hook called `useMutate`. These components allow sending requests with other HTTP verbs in order to mutate backend resources.

[![Edit restful-react demos](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/restful-react-demos-vjets)

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useGet, useMutate } from "restful-react";

const base = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com";

const ListItem = ({ id, children }) => {
  const { mutate: del, loading } = useMutate({
    verb: "DELETE",
    path: `/posts/`,
    base,
  });

  return (
    <li key={id}>
      {loading ? (
        "Deleting..."
      ) : (
        <button onClick={() => del(id).then(() => alert("Deleted successfully. Pretend it got removed from the DOM."))}>
          ❌
        </button>
      )}
      &nbsp;{children}
    </li>
  );
};

const MyHugeList = () => {
  const { data: posts } = useGet({
    path: "/posts",
    base,
  });
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Posts</h1>
      <ul>
        {posts &&
          posts.map(post => (
            <ListItem key={post.id} id={post.id}>
              {post.title}
            </ListItem>
          ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};
export default MyHugeList;
```

`useMutate` is strongly typed, and provides intelligent autocompletion out of the box, complete with other available [HTTP verbs](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods).

![Mutate](assets/mutate.png)

Each mutation returns a promise that can then be used to update local component state, dispatch an action, or do something else depending on your use case.

### Mocks

No backend support yet for your amazing feature? Need to isolate an edge case? You can easily provide a mock to `useMutate` and `useGet` to bypass the classic flow.

/!\ If `mock` option is provided, no requests will be send to the server. /!\

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useGet, useMutate } from "restful-react";

const base = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com";

// Mock the `mutate` handler
const { mutate: del, loading } = useMutate({
  verb: "DELETE",
  path: `/posts/`,
  base,
  // This will avoid any server call in favor of mock response
  mock: {
    mutate: id => console.log(`The item ${id} was deleted`),
  },
});

// Mock the `loading`, so it's easy to isolate the loading state
const { data: posts } = useGet({
  path: "/posts",
  base,
  // This will avoid any server call in favor of mock response
  mock: {
    loading: true,
  },
});

// Mock the `error`, so it's easy to isolate the error state
const { data: posts } = useGet({
  path: "/posts",
  base,
  // This will avoid any server call in favor of mock response
  mock: {
    error: "oh no!",
  },
});
```

### Polling with `Poll`

`restful-react` also exports a `Poll` render props component that will poll a backend endpoint over a predetermined interval until a stop condition is met. Consider,

```jsx
import { Poll } from "restful-react"

<Poll path="/deployLogs" resolve={data => data && data.data}>
  {(deployLogs: DeployLog[], { loading }) =>
    loading ? (
      <PageSpinner />
    ) : (
      <DataTable
        columns={["createdAt", "deployId", "status", "sha", "message"]}
        orderBy="createdAt"
        data={deployLogs}
        formatters={{
          createdAt: (d: DeployLog["createdAt"]) => title(formatRelative(d, Date.now())),
          sha: (i: DeployLog["sha"]) => i && i.slice(0, 7),
        }}
      />
    )
  }
</Poll>
```

`Poll` supports:

- an `interval` prop that will poll at a specified interval (defaults to polling 1 second), and
- an `until` prop that accepts a condition expressed as a function that returns a boolean value. When this condition is met, polling will stop.

  The signature of this function is `(data: T, response: ResponseInit) => boolean`. As a developer, you have access to the returned data, along with the response object in case you'd like to stop polling if `response.ok === false`, for example.

Below is a more convoluted example that employs nearly the full power of the `Poll` component.

```jsx
<Poll path="/status" until={(_, response) => response && response.ok} interval={0} lazy>
  {(_, { loading, error, finished, polling }, { start }) => {
    return loading ? (
      <Progress error={error} />
    ) : (
      <Button
        loading={editorLoading || polling}
        condensed
        icon="ExternalLink"
        color="ghost"
        onClick={() => {
          if (finished) {
            return window.open(editor.url);
          }
          requestEditor();
          start();
        }}
      >
        {finished ? "Launch Editor" : "Request Editor"}
      </Button>
    );
  }}
</Poll>
```

Note from the previous example, `Poll` also exposes more states: `finished`, and `polling` that allow better flow control, as well as lazy-start polls that can also be programmatically stopped at a later stage.

#### Long Polling

At Contiamo, we have a [powerful Long Polling specification](docs/contiamo-long-poll.md) in place that allows us to build real-time apps over HTTPS, as opposed to WebSockets. At a glance the specification can be distilled into:

- Web UI sends a request with a `Prefer` header that contains:
  - a time, in seconds, to keep requests open (`60s`), and
  - a **polling index** that is a server-sent hash `ahpiegh`.
  - all together, the client sends a request with a header `Prefer: wait=60s;index=939192`.
- The backend server responds, either with:
  - an empty response with status `304 Not Modified`
  - a successful response with data and a new **polling index**.

The polling index allow the client and the server to stay in sync: the client says "the last stuff I got was at this index". The server says "oh, let me get you up to speed and send you a new index".

Visually, this is represented as below.

![Contiamo Poll](docs/long-poll-flow.png).

To get this functionality in `restful-react`, this means specifying a `wait` prop on your `Poll` component, provided your server implements this specification as well.

#### [Full `Poll` Component API](src/Poll.tsx#L53-L101)

#### Polling and Code Generation

By default we generate a `Poll` component when the `prefer` header is specified in the OpenAPI/Swagger specs (more information about this design decision here -> https://github.com/contiamo/restful-react#long-polling).

We do not generate an equivalent hook version. Polling is quite trivial in a react hook, so we usually just use `useEffect` when we need some polling feature.

Example:

```ts
// Poll data if no completedAt
useEffect(() => {
  if (error) {
    return onError();
  } else if (data && !data.completedAt) {
    const timerId = window.setTimeout(() => refetch(), 1000);
    return () => window.clearTimeout(timerId);
  } else {
    return;
  }
}, [data, refetch, error]);
```

### Code Generation from OpenAPI / Swagger specs

`restful-react` is able to generate React hooks with appropriate type-signatures (TypeScript) from any valid OpenAPI v3 or Swagger v2 specification, either in `yaml` or `json` formats.

#### Usage

Type-safe React data fetchers can be generated from an OpenAPI specification using the following command:

- `restful-react import --file MY_OPENAPI_SPEC.yaml --output my-awesome-generated-types.tsx`

This command can be invoked by _either_:

- Installing `restful-react` globally and running it in the terminal: `npm i -g restful-react`, or
- Adding a `script` to your `package.json` like so:

```diff
      "scripts": {
        "start": "webpack-dev-server",
        "build": "webpack -p",
+       "generate-fetcher": "restful-react import --file MY_SWAGGER_DOCS.json --output FETCHERS.tsx"
      }
```

Your components can then be generated by running `npm run generate-fetcher`. Optionally, we recommend linting/prettifying the output for readability like so:

```diff
      "scripts": {
        "start": "webpack-dev-server",
        "build": "webpack -p",
        "generate-fetcher": "restful-react import --file MY_SWAGGER_DOCS.json --output FETCHERS.tsx",
+       "postgenerate-fetcher": "prettier FETCHERS.d.tsx --write"
      }
```

#### Validation of the OpenAPI specification

To enforce the best quality as possible of specification, we have integrated the amazing [OpenAPI linter from IBM](https://github.com/IBM/openapi-validator). We strongly encourage you to setup your custom rules with a `.validaterc` file, you can find all useful information about this configuration [here](https://github.com/IBM/openapi-validator/#configuration).

To activate this, add a `--validation` flag to your `restful-react` call.

#### Import from URL

Adding the `--url` flag to `restful-react import` instead of using the `--file` flag will attempt to fetch the spec from that endpoint.

- `restful-react import --url https://api.mine.com/openapi.json --output my-awesome-generated-types.tsx`

#### Import from GitHub

Adding the `--github` flag to `restful-react import` instead of using the `--file` flag allows us to **create React components from an OpenAPI spec _remotely hosted on GitHub._** <sup>_(how is this real life_ 🔥 _)_</sup>

To generate components from remote specifications, you'll need to follow the following steps:

1.  Visit [your GitHub settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
1.  Click **Generate New Token** and choose the following:

        Token Description: (enter anything)
        Scopes:
            [X] repo
                [X] repo:status
                [X] repo_deployment
                [X] public_repo
                [X] repo:invite

1.  Click **Generate token**.
1.  Copy the generated string.
1.  Open a terminal and run `restful-react import --github username:repo:branch:path/to/openapi.yaml --output MY_FETCHERS.tsx`, substituting things where necessary.
1.  You will be prompted for a token.
1.  Paste your token.
1.  You will be asked if you'd like to save it for later. This is _entirely_ up to you and completely safe: it is saved in your `node_modules` folder and _not_ committed to version control or sent to us or anything: the source code of this whole thing is public so you're safe.

    **Caveat:** _Since_ your token is stored in `node_modules`, your token will be removed on each `npm install` of `restful-react`.

1.  You're done! 🎉

#### Transforming an Original Spec

In some cases, you might need to augment an existing OpenAPI specification on the fly, for code-generation purposes. Our CLI makes this quite straightforward:

```bash
  restful-react import --file myspec.yaml --output mybettercomponents.tsx --transformer path/to/my-transformer.js
```

The function specified in `--transformer` is pure: it imports your `--file`, transforms it, and passes the augmented OpenAPI specification to `restful-react`'s generator. Here's how it can be used:

```ts
// /path/to/my-transformer.js

/**
 * Transformer function for restful-react.
 *
 * @param {OpenAPIObject} schema
 * @return {OpenAPIObject}
 */
module.exports = inputSchema => ({
  ...inputSchema,
  // Place your augmentations here
  paths: Object.entries(schema.paths).reduce(
    (mem, [path, pathItem]) => ({
      ...mem,
      [path]: Object.entries(pathItem).reduce(
        (pathItemMem, [verb, operation]) => ({
          ...pathItemMem,
          [verb]: {
            ...fixOperationId(path, verb, operation),
          },
        }),
        {},
      ),
    }),
    {},
  ),
});
```

#### Advanced configuration

`restful-react` supports the concept of "schema stitching" in a RESTful ecosystem as well. We are able to tie multiple backends together and generate code using a single configuration file, `restful-react.config.js`

To activate this "advanced mode", replace all flags from your `restful-react` call with the config flag: `--config restful-react.config.js` (or any filename that you want).

⚠️ **Note:** using a config file makes use of all of the options contained therein, and ignores all other CLI flags.

##### Config File Format

```ts
interface RestfulReactConfig {
  [backend: string]: {
    // classic configuration
    output: string;
    file?: string;
    github?: string;
    transformer?: string;
    validation?: boolean;
    skipReact?: boolean;

    // advanced configuration
    customImport?: string;
    customProps?: {
      base?: string;
    };
    pathParametersEncodingMode?: "uriComponent" | "rfc3986";
    customGenerator?: (data: {
      componentName: string;
      verb: string;
      route: string;
      description: string;
      genericsTypes: string;
      operation: OperationObject;
      paramsInPath: string[];
      paramsTypes: string;
    }) => string;
  };
}
```

##### Config File Example

```js
// restful-react.config.js
/**
 * Restful-react configuration.
 *
 * @type {import("restful-react/dist/bin/config").RestfulReactAdvancedConfiguration}
 */
module.exports = {
  myFirstBackend: {
    output: "src/queries/myFirstBackend.tsx",
    file: "specs/my-first-backend.yaml",
    customProps: {
      base: `"http://my-first-backend.com"`,
    },
  },
  configurableBackend: {
    output: "src/queries/configurableBackend.tsx",
    github: "contiamo:restful-react:master:docs/swagger.json",
    customImport: `import { getConfig } from "../components/Config.tsx";`,
    customProps: {
      base: `{getConfig("backendBasePath")}`,
    },
  },
};
```

```json
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "gen": "restful-react import --config restful-react.config.js",
    "gen-first": "restful-react import --config restful-react.config.js myFirstBackend"
  }
}
```

##### Custom generator

To support even more advanced usecases (like a promise base API, mock generator or anything else that can infer from your specs), you can define your own template in `customGenerator`. This function will be call for each route with some useful computed values (see the types above) and the resulted string will be added to the generated file.

You can see a concrete usage inside the `examples` folder and try yourself in this repository with the following command:

- `yarn build`
- `yarn example:advanced petstore-custom-fetch`

You can inspect the result inside `/examples/petstoreFromFileSpecWithCustomFetch.tsx`

##### Only generating custom code (no react hooks/components)

In some cases you might want to use the familiar restful-react to generate code for non-react environments (e.g. promise-based fetchers for nodejs or other frameworks). In this case, you can disable react code generation altogether by passing the `--skipReact` flag or, if you are using a configuration file, setting `skipReact: true`.

When set, only your custom generators will be executed.

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome – especially:

- documentation,
- bug reports and issues,
- code contributions.

### Code

If you'd like to actively develop or help maintain this project then there are existing tests against which you can test the library with. Typically, this looks like

- `git clone git@github.com:contiamo/restful-react.git`
- `cd restful-react`
- `yarn install`
- `yarn test --watch`

From there, you should be able to start developing without problems.

### How to publish to npm

Just update the `version` in `package.json`!

As soon as your branch will be merged to master, a new npm version will be automatically published for you.

## `@without-cli` npm package

If for any reasons you don't want to use our CLI to generate restful-react components, we provide a `without-cli` version of the package.

Just `npm install restful-react@without-cli` to have this light version.

This version will follow `latest` but without the cli part (more details into `publish-without-cli.js`).

## Next Steps

We're actively developing this at Contiamo to meet our use cases as they arise. If you have a use case that you'd like to implement, do it! Open an issue, submit a Pull Request, have fun! We're friendly.
